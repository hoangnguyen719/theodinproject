      <caption><strong>Steps</strong></caption>
      <li>
        <strong>Prep the protein.</strong>
        In order to slice the beef, chicken or pork as thinly as possible, I
        recommend popping the meat in the freezer for at least 30-45 minutes to
        chill. Then use a sharp knife to thinly slice the meat before adding it
        to the soup.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make the broth.</strong>
        Meanwhile, as the meat is chilling, char the onion and ginger (either in
        a skillet or under the broiler). Meanwhile, briefly toast the spices in
        a large stockpot. Then add in the onion, ginger, and broth. Cover and
        let everything simmer together for at least 30 minutes so that all of
        those flavors can meld. Strain out and discard all of the onions, ginger
         and spices. Then stir in the remaining ingredients and season with
         salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prep the noodles.</strong>
        Meanwhile, as your broth is simmering, go ahead and cook the noodles al
        dente according to the package instructions. Drain in a strainer, then
        toss briefly with cold water to prevent the noodles from continuing to
        cook, and set aside. (I also recommend tossing the noodles with a
        drizzle of oil — such as sesame oil — to prevent them from sticking.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assemble.</strong>
        Once everything is ready to go, add a handful of noodles to each
        individual serving bowl, topped with your desired protein. Then ladle
        the simmering hot broth into the serving bowls, being sure to submerge
        the meat so that it will get cooked. Top with lots and lots of
        garnishes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve.</strong>
        And serve warm, encouraging everyone to stir the garnishes into the
        soup so that they can flavor the broth, also adding in additional extra
        sauces if desired.
