      <strong>Description</strong>:
      A steak is a meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers,
      potentially including a bone. It is normally grilled, though it can
      also be pan-fried. Steak can also be cooked in sauce, such as in steak
      and kidney pie, or minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers.
      (according to
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steak">Wikipedia</a>).

      <caption><strong>Ingredients</strong></caption>
      <li>
        <strong>Thickish cut steak</strong>
        - no more than 2.5cm/1″ thick, because we want to cook this entirely
        on the stove (thicker cuts need to be finished in the oven).
        <b>Ideal steaks</b>: boneless rib eye / scotch fillet,
        porterhouse / New York, T-bone.
        <b>Grade</b>: takes high quality steak over the top amazing,
        really elevates economical steak.
      </li>
      <li>Butter, garlic and fresh thyme</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <ol class="list-w-margin">
      <caption><strong>Steps</strong></caption>
      <li>
        <strong>Bring to room temp!</strong>
        This makes an amazing difference to cooking through evenly rather than
        ending up with a thick overcooked band in order for the very centre to
        be cooked to your liking;
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pat dry</strong>
        and season the steak generously with salt and pepper – this helps form
        that amazing crust we all know and love about great steaks;
      </li>
      <li>
        Get your skillet
        <strong>SMOKING HOT</strong>
        before putting the steak in – again, for the crust
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>WARNING</strong>:
        The butter will sputter when you add the thyme, so stand back!
      </li>
      <li>
        Take the steak off the stove <strong>BEFORE your desired internal
          temperature</strong> (see chart below) because the internal
          temperature will continue to rise as it rests
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>REST</strong>
        your steak for 5 to 10 minutes so it sucks its own juices back in and the fibres relax. This is a must-do step
        for any protein you cook hard and fast!
      </li>
